# 🐶 My DogFood Review Platform

Welcome to my DogFood Review Platform project! As a dog enthusiast, I've created an interactive web application that allows fellow dog owners to share and find reviews for various dog food products. Whether you're on a quest for the healthiest option for your furry companion or simply want to connect with other dog lovers, this platform provides a valuable resource for exploring different dog food brands.

## 🔧 Technologies and Concepts

In this project, I've employed a diverse range of technologies to ensure a seamless and enjoyable user experience:

- **SQL & Entity Framework**: I've harnessed the power of SQL for efficient data management and paired it with Entity Framework to simplify database interactions. This combination enables me to effortlessly handle CRUD operations.
- **ASP.NET & Blazor**: The backbone of my application is built on ASP.NET, providing a strong foundation for processing user requests. Integrating Blazor pages brings interactivity and dynamism to the forefront, enhancing user engagement.
- **C# Coding**: With C#, I've crafted the application's logic, creating a robust and maintainable codebase to support the platform's functionality.
- **API Manipulation**: I've exposed APIs to encourage third-party developers to integrate with my platform, fostering an ecosystem of applications centered around dog food reviews.
- **SQL Editing**: Users can seamlessly edit their reviews through an intuitive interface, which in turn triggers SQL edits behind the scenes, ensuring accurate updates to the database.
- **CRUD Operations**: I've seamlessly integrated the fundamental CRUD operations, empowering users to effortlessly manage their reviews.
- **JavaScript, HTML & CSS**: These frontend technologies collaborate harmoniously to deliver an engaging and user-friendly interface. JavaScript enhances interactivity, while HTML and CSS ensure a polished layout and styling.
